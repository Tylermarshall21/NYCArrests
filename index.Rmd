# Introduction

## Overview of analysis:

We plan to explore the arrests that occur in New York City, and how these correspond to various factors. 
Here are some areas we will explore:

1. The past fifteen years have heralded a whirlwind of events. Since 2006, we have had a major economic recession and recovery, a worldwide pandemic, and many legislative developments, such as the legalization of marijuana and same-sex marriage. These are events that impact people’s lives – and we would like to explore how this impact manifests itself specifically in the form of arrests. It might be reasoned that ‘positive’ events, economic or otherwise, would lead to fewer arrests – is this the case?
  a. How do major events, such as elections, lockdowns, and legalizations/decriminalization impact the arrest rate in NYC? Are certain demographics, or types of crimes, more impacted than others? 
  b. How do minor events, such as won or lost sports games, parades, and other public gatherings impact local numbers of arrests in NYC? What crimes tend to be more common around certain events? Is this what we would expect or is something surprising going on in the data?
2. Which crimes run contrary to ongoing trends in overall arrests? For example, if arrests are down for most crimes, which crimes show increases in numbers of arrests? 
  a. We may also be interested in exploring how external trends may impact the rates of arrest for certain crimes. For example, have there been fewer drunk driving arrests since apps such as Uber and Lyft have made their debut?
3. It is certain that every crime committed does not correspond to exactly one arrest. We are interested to explore any patterns in discrepancies between crimes committed and arrests made
  a. Which crimes have the highest arrest rates, relative to the number of crimes of the type committed?
  b. Are there clear patterns of bias present in the arrests made in NYC?
