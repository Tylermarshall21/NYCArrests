[["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion In our project, we were able to explore various aspects of arrest and crime data from New York City over the past ten years. We were able to learn that arrests have definitely gone down during this time period, but crime data suggests not much has changed. That is not necessarily a good sign for safety in New York City, but is what the data is telling us. We were also able to see what the days of the week had the biggest arrest days, and somewhat surprisingly the top 50 days in terms of arrests were all either Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday. Our other explorations allowed us to see the impact of laws changing in regards to marijuana arrests as well as the impact of drunk driving arrests after Uber and Lyft were introduced. However, we also faced some limitations during our analysis. The first limitation we had was that we had to limit our data to the last 10 years because of the size of the dataset. This prevented us from being able to look at the impact of the recession on arrests which was one of the questions we were initially arrested. Another limitation we faced during our project was when we were comparing arrests with crime. The crime data we had access to was annual data, so we were only able to make year-to-year comparisons with the arrest data. We were unable to make month-by-month or day-by-day comparisons with the crime data to see if it was similar to some of the results we found with the arrest data. One lesson we learned from working with this data is that the results might not necessary always be what might be expected or something that is easy to explain. When we created the Cleveland dot plot for the days with the most arrests, we were unable to identify why those days had the most arrests. We were hopeful that there might have been some events that could help explain what was going on that day, but we were unable to figure out what happened to cause so many arrests. With the Thanksgiving Day parade heatmap, we thought arrests might be higher due to thefts around the parade, but this was not the case. From this project, we learned that it is important to explore the data in these ways because the results might not be what was expected going in. In terms of future directions, I think we could go back and look at the data from 2006-2010 to see how those 5 years compared to the last 10 years. This would allow us to look at the the impact of the recession on arrests while also giving us a larger picture of how New York City has been changing. Also, we could look to bring in some other datasets like we did with the crime data to see if we could better explain some of our results. If we were able to find a dataset that contained big events going on around the city, that data could potentially help us better explain our results in certain areas. Overall, we were able to learn a lot about arrests and crime in New York City throughout our exploration, but there is definitely still more to do with a dataset of this magnitude.
